# Real

## Game Concept
Real is a neighborhood building game where each player owns a plot and customizes their space. Home interiors and decorations are generated by AI to keep every plot unique.

## Folder Structure
- **unity-client** – Unity project with game scenes, scripts, and assets.
- **backend** – Server code and APIs for authentication, world state, and player data.
- **ml-models** – Training scripts and models for the procedural decor system.

## Running the Game
1. Open `unity-client` in Unity Hub.
2. Press Play in the Unity editor or build the client from the build menu.

## Contributing and Tests
Pull requests are welcome. Run `dotnet build` in the root folder to make sure the C# projects compile. If you add tests, place them under `backend` or as Unity play mode tests and run them before submitting.
